# CBF-Constrained PPO

This repository contains the framework used to conduct the experiments for our paper "Sampling-Based Safe Reinforcement Learning for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems", appearing in _Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS)_, 2024.



### Usage

1) Install the packages in `setup.py`
2) Go to `experiments` directory and select the experiment (e.g., `Testing-projection.py` or `Testing-beta-sampling.py`) that you wish to run
3) You'll see plots being stored in the corresponding experiment folder
